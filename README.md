PythonPrograms

Various BeagleBone Black Python programs for fun and to ward off evil spirits.
Many of these use AdaFruit libraries or are lifted from David Beazley's Python Essential Reference.

Arranged in several categories:

gpio*.py	- exercise individual i/o pins

i2c*.py		- connect to modules using the I2C bus
